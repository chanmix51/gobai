GOBAI tag oriented web shop
===========================

This is a simple and efficient web shop mainly aimed at classifying items using nested tags in Postgresql.

It uses `Silex<http://silex.sensiolabs.org/>` and `Postgresql<http://www.postgresql.org/>` with `Pomm<pomm.coolkeums.org/>`.

This software is so alpha you do not want to use it unless you know what you are doing.
